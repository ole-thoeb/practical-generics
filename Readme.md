# Practical generics
This repo contains several task that guide you step by step through building your own generic types.
Understand generics better by using them to solve tasks.

## Structure
Each task is divided into subtask, guiding you to the goal. 
For each subtask there are hints in case you get stuck. There are also sample solutions provided. 

If the instructions are unclear to you, maybe take a look at the tests. The tests provide you with examples and verify that your implementation is correct.

Additionally some subtasks have a challenge variant, apposing additional constraints on the implementation.

## Tasks
